# Amiga Replacement Project

This is an attempt to make clean Verilog sources for each chip on the Amiga. Unlike MiniMig and related implementations, this seeks to maintain perfect compatibility with the whole chip and the whole chip only to serve as a second-source to the slowly disappearing stock of Amiga chips. These will be drop-in replacements.
