1. DEFINITION

  1.1 GENERAL DESCRIPTION

        Gary is a custom gate array IC using in the A500 and A2000, collectively referred to as the A2500 henceforth. It is packaged in a 48-pin DIP chip whose pinout is shown below. Gary provides many different 'glue' functions for the system. These functions are:

        - Address decoding for Kickstart ROM
        - Address decoding for Chip RAM
        - Address decoding for chip registers
        - Address decoding and timing for 8520s (CIAs)
        - Address decoding and timing for Real Time Clock (RTC)
        - Monitoring of the bus for timeout conditions
        - System RESET logic

  2.1 OPERATION DESCRIPTION

    2.1.1 UNSUPPORTED FEATURES

        Gary does not manage either the 68000's Function Codes (thus all memory
        is available in both user and supervisor modes, to both program and
        data fetches) nor any of the bus arbitration (which is handled by
        separate logic). Additionally, the Amiga does not use IACKs or extended
        exceptions, so no interrupt handling is present on Gary.

    2.1.2 ADDRESSES

        Address lines A23~A17 are connected to the processor address bus and are
        used to generate the various device decodes.

    2.1.3 ROM

        The onboard ROMs are selected in the address range $F80000 to $FFFFFF.
        The ROMs are also selected in the range from $000000 to $1FFFFF when
        the overlay input signal (OVL) is true (this allows the RESET
        instructions to be contained in the ROMs).

        Access to the onboard ROMs is zero-wait.

    2.1.4 CHIP RAM

        Chip RAM is selected in the address range from $000000 to $1FFFFF. When
        the OVL input is true (high), Chip RAM is not selected for these
        addresses and ROM appears here instead. The CPU cucle is terminated
        using DTACK which also serves to synchronize the 68000 to the Video DMA
        timing.

        Access to the onboard Chip RAM is zero-wait when not being blocked by
        Agnus.

    2.1.5 8520s

        There are two 8520 CIA ICs on the mainboard, referred to here as CIA0
        and CIA1. CIA0 is selected in the address range from $BFE000 to
        $BFEFFF. CIA1 is selected from $BFD000 to $BFDFFF. Both CIAs are only
        8 bits wide, but respond as 16 bits for compatibility. In order to read
        the 8 bits, CIA0 must be read at an odd word address and CIA1 must be
        read at an even word address.

        The CIAs operate on the E CLK which is generated by the 68000 at a
        ratio of 1/10th the processor clock. Gary is only responsible for
        generating the VPA signal and does not induce any wait states.

    2.1.6 REAL TIME CLOCK (RTC)
    
        The RTC is selected in the range from $DC0000 to $DCFFFF. It is
        actually only 4 bits but respondsas 16-bits fo compatibility. In order
        to read the 4 bits, the RTC must be read at an odd word address.

        Gary will add three additional wait states when accessing the RTC.

    2.1.7 EXPANSION RAM

        Expansion RAM signal is externally pulled up.  The expansion RAM card
        grounds this line.  This signal is used in the generation of /RAMEN. 
        
  2.2 SIGNAL DSCRIPTION

        /AS (Address Strobe) indicates the start of a bus cycle and remains
        asserted for the duration of the cycle.  Processor addresses (A1:23),
        status FC0:2 and R/W are valid while /AS is asserted. 

        /xDS (Upper/Lower Data Strobes) indicated data is valid during a
        write or enable read data to drive the data bus.  /UDS indicates valid
        data on D7:15 and /LDS indicates valid data on D0:7. 

        R/W (Processor Read/Write) indicates the direction of data buss
        transfer.  R/W =0 is a processor write. 

        /DTACK (Data Transfer ACKnowledge) is an open collector or tri-state
        output drives the CPU /DTACK input.  The 68000 requires /DTACK=0 to
        complete either a read or write cycle.  This signal sets up to the end
        of processor state S4.  If /DTACK=0, the cycle will complete normally. 
        If /DTACK=1, the processor will add wait states until /DTACK=0 before
        advancing to S5 and then completing the cycle.  If /DTACK is never
        asserted (=0), the processor will hang up. This circuit provides /DTACK
        generation for all internal memory accesses and is available for
        external device use (via XRDY) if desired.  If the external device
        desires to control /DTACK directly, the /OVR signal can be asserted
        which tri-states (or forces one in the case of open collector) the
        /DTACK output. 

        XRDY (eXternal ReaDY) input is used by external devices to control the
        internal /DTACK generation in the case where /DTACK is needed to cause
        processor wait states. If XRDY is not asserted by an external device,
        the internal circuit will generate an /DTACK which does not generate any
        processor wait states.  Since XRDY can only de-assert /DTACK, this
        circuit will prevent the system from hanging up in the event that
        non-existant memory locations are accessed. 

        See Appendix A for timing diagrams.

        /OVR (OVeRide) input directly disables the internal generation of
        /DTACK and internal device selects.  This pin allows external devices to
        map themselves in place of existing devices (such as ROM).  In this
        case, the external device must assert it's own /DTACK.  The timing of
        this circuit IS NOR RELIABLE FOR REPLACING VIDEO RAM (/RAMEN) OR VIDEO
        REGISTERS (/ROMEN).

        OVL (OVerLay) input causes ROM to be accessed at memory location 0. 
        This signal is typically driven by a port line so that ROM is mapped to
        the memory 0 at RST time. 

        /BLIT(Data Bus Request) input indicates that the Amiga custom chips
        are performing a video bus DMA.  The circuit delays generation of
        /DTACK, thereby delaying the CPU if it attempts to access the video bus
        address range while /BLITis asserted. 
        
        /BLISS (BLitter Slowdown) output drives the custom chip blitter
        slowdown input.  When the CPU address in BANK6 area, /BLISS is asserted. 

        /BGACK (Bus Grant ACKnowledge) input indicates that an external DMA
        devices has taken control of the processor busses. 

        /RAMEN (RAM Enable) output indicates that the CPU is accessing video
        bus RAM (this includes expansion RAM). 

        /REGEN (RGA Enable) output indicates that the CPU is accessing Amiga
        custom chip register space.; 

        /OEL (Chip->68000 Buffer) output enables the output buffers of the video
        bus data latch to drive the CPU data bus. 

        /OEB (68000->Chip Buffer) output enables the video data buffers to drive
        the video data bus. 

        /LATCH (Clock 4) output is used to latch data on the video data bus. It
        is regenerating the original Amiga 1000 C4 that is absent.

        /VPA (Valid Peripheral Address) output indicates that the CPU is
        accessing an 6800 type peripheral (such as the 8520) and causes the CPU
        to perform a 6800 compatible cycle. 

        /ROMEN (ROM Enable) output is the chip select for the internal 2Mb
        ROM. 

        /CLKRD /CLKWR (Real Time Clock Read/Write) outputs are the read/write
        enables used for data transfers to and from the the real time clock
        circuit.  RTC clock transfers all have an additional three wait states
        inserted before /DTACK.

        MTRON is the signal that tells the floppy motor to turn on. It it the
        /MTR input latched by the /SEL  input. MTRON is gauranteed negated when
        RST is asserted.

        MTRX is the signal that tells the floppy motor what to do. It follows
        the /MTR input except during reset when it's gauranteed negated.

        DKWDB is a buffered version of the /DKWD signal.

        DKWEB follows DKWE except it is negated during reset.

  2.3 ADDRESS DECODING

        Gary splits the Amiga memory into eight 2MB sections by selecting the
        high three bits of the address. These are then subdivided for BANK 5
        (8-bit CIA chips) and BANK 6 (16-bit chips). Addresses not decoded in
        the table below should be regarded as reserved and are not used on the
        Amiga 500/2000.

        Bits        Address Range           Bank
        ----        -------------           ----
        b000        0xxxxx-1xxxxx           Chip RAM (RAMEN if OVL=L) or
                                            Kickstart (ROMEN if OVL=H)

        b101        Axxxxx-Bxxxxx
        b---1_111x  BExxxx-BFxxxx           CIA Chip Access (VPA)

        b---1_0xxx  D0xxxx-D7xxxx           Ranger RAM (512KB)
        b---1_1100  DCxxxx                  Real Time Clock (RTCWD/RD)
        b---1_1111  DFxxxx                  Custom Chip Access (RGAEN)

        b111        Exxxxx-Fxxxxx           Kickstart (ROMEN if OVL=L)

        The /DTACK circuit has to generate /DTACK for all onboard devices and
        also for expansion space (to avoid system hangs). ROM, RAM and custom
        chip registers are special because it is necessary to synchronize them
        top a specific phase of the CCK CCKQ clocks.

        See Appendix A for Timing Diagrams.

        fixturing).  All time measurements of driven signals are referenced 
        to 1.5V on inputs and outputs.  See figure (xx) for timing relationships.

      (1) - /DTACK is a potential system problem in the case where /OVR is
            activited after AS- (S2) has already asserted /TDACK.  In this
            event, /DTACK can not be guaranteed to be pulled high before S5
            because of the pullup resistance and node capacitance.  This is
            the case with either Toshiba gate array or 5719. 

      (2) - Many signals are not critical timings.  50ns was selected as a
            convenient, non-critical value.

APPENDIX B. A2000 PALASM EQUATIONS

    Gary is essentially an amalgamation of the two programmable gate array
    chips PALEN (U26), PALCAS (U27), as well as various discrete logic chips.
    As such the A2000 PALASM EQUATIONS serve as a reference for the internal
    logic for Gary if required.

    DESCRIPTION

        NAMING CONVENTIONS HAVE BEEN UPDATED AS PER MODERN COMMODORE NAMING
        CONVENTIONS (E.G., CCK WAS C1).

        THE CLOCK IS NOW TILED THROUGHOUT THE SPACE $D80000-D8FFFF.  IF
        MORE PRECISE SELECTION TO $D80000-$D8FFFF IS REALLY NEEDED, THEN
        THIS MUST BE DONE EXTERNALLY USING THE /CS INPUT ON THE CLOCK CHIP.

        DTACK FOR THE CLOCK IS HANDLED IN THE MYRAME EQUATION BECAUSE THE DTACK
        EQUATION ALREADY HAS 7 OR TERMS!  THIS MEANS THAT CLOCK ACCESSES WILL BE
        SYNCHRONIZED TO VIDEO CYCLES, BUT THIS SHOULD CREATE NO MAJOR PROBLEMS.

        THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ROMEN/MYRAME MATCHES THE A1000 -  IT MIGHT BE
        DESIREABLE TO HAVE THE ADDRESS RANGE IN MYRAME MATCH THE ROM SELECT
        ADDRESS RANGE...

        MYRAME OUTPUT IS NOT USED EXTERNALLY - ONLY INTERNAL USAGE!!!

        ENA IS NOT USED EXTERNALLY - ONLY INTERNAL USAGE!!!
